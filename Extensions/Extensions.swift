/*
 1.Create a computed extension property on String called unicornLevel
 
 Calculates one unicorn for each character in the recipient String
 Use this totes adorbs unicorn emoji ğŸ¦„ directly in your code. For example:
 let unicornPhrase = "My ğŸ¦„ is awesome"
 print(unicornPhrase)
 Console output: My ğŸ¦„ is awesome
 
 2.You probably haven't interacted with UIView much or maybe not at all, but let's get our unicorn status to be displayed in the simulator. Don't worry too much about how it's doing it just yet. You'll get into that later on!
